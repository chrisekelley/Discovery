                   Discovery is a very simple but useful library for discovering nearby devices with BLE and to exchange a value (kind of ID or username determined by you on the running app on peer device) wheather the app on peer device is working at foregorund or background state.

Discovery:
* lets you easily discover nearby devices
* retrieve their id(assigned by you) wheather the app works on foreground or background state
* hides the nitty gritty details of BLE calls and delegates from the developer
* determines the proximity of the peer device
